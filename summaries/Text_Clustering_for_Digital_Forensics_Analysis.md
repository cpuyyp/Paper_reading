Two key aspects in forensics: the acquisition and retrieval of information extracted from digital devices, and the following data analysis.
two-steps investigative process is proposed, based on
- textual information extraction
 - bit-stream acquisition and early analysis
 - textual information extraction
- textual data analysis via clustering-based text mining tools.
